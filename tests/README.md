# Overview of the test projects

We have two test projects you can use when writing your tests:

1. - Casestudy: `test`
   - Selection process: `testing`
   - Contains the following data:
     * Commits
     * Mails
     * Issues
     * Authors
     * Commit messages 
     * Pasta
     * Synchronicity
2. - Casestudy: `test_empty`
   - Selection process: `testing`
   - Contains the following data:
     * Authors

Please note, that there cannot be a project without author data as in this case, `coronet` stops when reading the data. Everything else can be empty.
